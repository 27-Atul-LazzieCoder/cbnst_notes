Real-Life Applications
The Taylor series method is particularly useful when dealing with problems where:

The function's behavior needs to be approximated locally.
High precision is required over small intervals.
The function and its derivatives are easily computable.
Examples:
Engineering: Predicting the behavior of dynamic systems, such as the stress and strain in materials under load.
Aerospace: Calculating the position and velocity of an aircraft over a short time interval.
Physics: Modeling the motion of particles in a potential field.
Finance: Estimating the future value of financial derivatives based on their current value and rate of change.
The Taylor series method provides a powerful tool for approximating solutions to differential equations, particularly useful in fields requiring precise numerical methods.
