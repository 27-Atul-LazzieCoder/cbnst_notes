what is taylors series method 
 The Taylor series method is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to differential equations by expanding functions into their Taylor series. The Taylor series of a function 
f(t) about a point 
𝑡0-is given by:

f(t)=f(t0)+(t−t0)f′(t0)+2!(t−t0)2f′′(t0)+3!(t−t0)3f′′′(t0)+⋯

For practical purposes, the series is often truncated to a finite number of terms, providing an approximation of the function.

When applying the Taylor series method to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE), the idea is to use this series to estimate the value of the function at a future point based on its value and derivatives at the current point.

Steps for Applying the Taylor Series Method
Write the Differential Equation:
Consider a first-order ODE:
dtdy=f(t,y)

Expand y(t) in a Taylor Series:
Expand 
y(t)=y(tn)+(t−tn)y′(tn)+2!(t−tn)2y′′(tn)+3!(t−tn)3y′′′(tn)+⋯

Determine the Derivatives:
Calculate the derivatives of 
1.	Determine the Derivatives: Calculate the derivatives of 𝑦(𝑡)y(t) using the original differential equation and its higher-order derivatives: 𝑦′(𝑡𝑛)=𝑓(𝑡𝑛,𝑦𝑛)y′(tn)=f(tn,yn) 𝑦′′(𝑡𝑛)=𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑓(𝑡,𝑦)∣(𝑡𝑛,𝑦𝑛)=𝑓𝑡(𝑡𝑛,𝑦𝑛)+𝑓𝑦(𝑡𝑛,𝑦𝑛)𝑓(𝑡𝑛,𝑦𝑛)y′′(tn)=dtdf(t,y)∣∣(tn,yn)=ft(tn,yn)+fy(tn,yn)f(tn,yn) Here, 𝑓𝑡ft and 𝑓𝑦fy represent partial derivatives with respect to 𝑡t and 𝑦y.
2.	Truncate the Series: To approximate 𝑦(𝑡)y(t) at 𝑡=𝑡𝑛+1=𝑡𝑛+ℎt=tn+1=tn+h, truncate the series to the desired number of terms. For a second-order Taylor series, it would look like: 𝑦𝑛+1≈𝑦𝑛+ℎ𝑦′(𝑡𝑛)+ℎ22𝑦′′(𝑡𝑛)yn+1≈yn+hy′(tn)+2h2y′′(tn)
3.	Update the Values: Use the truncated series to calculate 𝑦𝑛+1yn+1: 𝑦𝑛+1≈𝑦𝑛+ℎ𝑓(𝑡𝑛,𝑦𝑛)+ℎ22(𝑓𝑡(𝑡𝑛,𝑦𝑛)+𝑓𝑦(𝑡𝑛,𝑦𝑛)𝑓(𝑡𝑛,𝑦𝑛))yn+1≈yn+hf(tn,yn)+2h2(ft(tn,yn)+fy(tn,yn)f(tn,yn))
Example
Consider the ODE: 𝑑𝑦𝑑𝑡=−2𝑡𝑦dtdy=−2ty with initial condition 𝑦(0)=1y(0)=1.
1.	First Derivative: 𝑦′(𝑡)=𝑓(𝑡,𝑦)=−2𝑡𝑦y′(t)=f(t,y)=−2ty
2.	Second Derivative: 𝑦′′(𝑡)=𝑑𝑑𝑡(−2𝑡𝑦)=−2𝑦−2𝑡(−2𝑡𝑦)=−2𝑦+4𝑡2𝑦y′′(t)=dtd(−2ty)=−2y−2t(−2ty)=−2y+4t2y
3.	Using the Taylor Series: 𝑦𝑛+1≈𝑦𝑛+ℎ𝑦′(𝑡𝑛)+ℎ22𝑦′′(𝑡𝑛)yn+1≈yn+hy′(tn)+2h2y′′(tn) 𝑦𝑛+1≈𝑦𝑛+ℎ(−2𝑡𝑛𝑦𝑛)+ℎ22(−2𝑦𝑛+4𝑡𝑛2𝑦𝑛)yn+1≈yn+h(−2tnyn)+2h2(−2yn+4tn2yn)
